1. Unary Operators:
Unary operators operate on a single operand (variable or value).
Examples of unary operators include the unary plus (+), unary minus (-), increment (++), decrement (--), and logical NOT (!).
EXAMPLE:

let a = 5;
let b = -a;  // Unary minus operator
let c = ++a; // Increment operator
let d = !true; // Logical NOT operator


2.Binary Operators:
Binary operators operate on two operands (variables or values).
Examples of binary operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), assignment (=), equality (==), and logical AND (&&).

EXAMPLE:

let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let sum = x + y;  // Binary addition operator
let difference = x - y;  // Binary subtraction operator
let product = x * y;  // Binary multiplication operator
let quotient = x / y;  // Binary division operator
let isEqual = x === y;  // Binary equality operator
